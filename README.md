- **CSS3**: Modern layouts, HSL colors, and animations.

## 📜 Rules
1. Pieces move diagonally on dark squares.
2. If a jump is available, it **must** be taken (Forced Capture).
3. If a piece can jump again after a capture, it must continue the sequence.
4. Pieces are promoted to Kings when they reach the opposite end. Kings can move and jump backwards.
